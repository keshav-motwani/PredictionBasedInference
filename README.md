# Valid inference after prediction

Code and results for "Valid Inference after prediction" by Keshav Motwani and Daniela Witten. See preprint here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13746.

The code in this repository is based on the code in https://osf.io/g4w28/. We thank Wang et al. (2020) for making their code public, which enabled us to investigate the method further in this manuscript. The original script by Wang et al. (2020) is duplicated in this repository for easy comparison (for example, using diff).

The only difference from the simulation setup in Wang et al. (2020) is that we consider varying sample sizes, as well as consider using a fixed machine learning model (referred to as fixed_train throughout the code and results files). See the associated manuscript for details.
